In this projects I will implement Fisher’s Linear Discriminant classification algorithm that can recognize
scanned images of the 10 digits (0 to 9). The zip file contains two folders: “Train” and “Test”. The “Train” folder contains 240 images for each digit, while the “Test” folder
contains 20 images for each digit. The images in the “Train” folder should be used to train a classifierfor each digit. The folder contains a file named “Training
Labels.txt” which includes the labels of the 2400 images in order. After the classifiers are trained, test
each classifier using the images given in the “Test” folder. The folder also contains a text file named “Test
Labels.txt” which include the labels of the 200 images in order.
